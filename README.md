# Hello World! 💻

👋 My name is Kian Zahrai, and ever since I found myself stumbling across the domain of Computer Science, my passion for learning has only continued to grow. From the microcosm of bits, diversifying to much grander realms of Artificial Intelligence, it drives me to envision how they play within our civilization.

🕹️ I seek to contribute my technical expertise to ingenious projects and make long-lasting impacts. With a strong foundation in various programming languages and a diverse skill set in software development, I aspire to join a forward-thinking team where I can leverage my experience and knowledge to create cutting-edge solutions in the software development landscape.

⚽ Beyond the code, you may find me conversing in other topics that excite me just as much as my profession. However, none of them even amount to my devotion to soccer. The beautiful game has given me more than just fun and play, it has also gifted me with the joy to keep going, whatever it takes.
 
🤝 Looking forward to connecting with like-minded individuals and exploring new opportunities in the world of technology and others.
